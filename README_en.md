## Sonda-import
Network data usage "[SONDA](http://sonda.ccst.inpe.br/)" for plotting graphs of irradiance.

``` Observation: this project is not finished! the images are about the problems. ```

As is called the function myrange the number of times is incremented.
* 1 turn or 1 day = 1439 min --- minute graph 0 to 1439.
* 2 turn or 2 day = 2878 min --- minute graph 1439 to 2878.
* 3 turn or 3 day = 2878 min --- minute graph 2878 to 4317.

## Problems
* Problem 1: From the second graph it prints the coordinates equal to the first one, problem maybe related to the array.

## Utils
* [VARIABLES](http://sonda.ccst.inpe.br/infos/variaveis.html)
* [DATABASE](http://sonda.ccst.inpe.br/basedados/index.html)
